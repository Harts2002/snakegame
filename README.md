# snakegame
A classic snakegame made with processing. You can find this game on my personal webpage.
The pinkish square is the snake and the red square is the apple which you need to eat. Every ten points (ten apples) the game will speed up and when the snake eats itself it'll lose points and decrease its lives which starts at 3. If the snake hits the border of the screen it's an automatic game over.
